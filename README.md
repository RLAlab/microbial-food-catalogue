# Microbial Food Innovation Catalogue

[![GitHub Pages](https://img.shields.io/github/deployments/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME/github-pages?label=Website&style=flat-square)](https://rlalab.org/microbial-food-innovation-catalogue/)

This repository hosts an open-source catalogue of databases and computational tools relevant to microbial food innovation.
It is a companion resource to the perspective on the **AI Agenda for Microbial Foods**, designed to support researchers, accelerate development, and help coordinate progress in the field.

## 🚀 View the Live Catalogue

## 🎯 About This Project

Microbial foods offer a sustainable and nutritious path to feeding the future. To accelerate their development and overcome hurdles in scale-up, sensory performance, and safety, we must leverage the potential of AI.

This catalogue supports the four priorities of the proposed AI Agenda for Microbial Foods:
1.  Food-Tailored Data
2.  Self-Driving Execution
3.  Predictive Cross-Scale Modelling
4.  Evidence-Based Translation

This resource aims to help researchers navigate the rapidly developing landscape of computational tools and data.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

This is a community-driven project. We welcome and encourage contributions to keep this catalogue accurate and comprehensive. The easiest way to add a new resource is:

1.  **Navigate to the `data/` folder** in this repository.
2.  Choose either `databases.csv` or `tools.csv` and click on it.
3.  Click the **pencil icon (✏️)** in the top-right to edit the file.
4.  Add your new resource as a new row at the end of the file, following the existing comma-separated format.
5.  At the bottom of the page, write a brief description (e.g., "Added new database: XYZ") and click "**Propose changes**".

This will create a "Pull Request," which we will review and merge.

Alternatively, if you find a bug or have a suggestion, please [open an issue](https://github.com/RLAlab/microbial-food-innovation-catalogue/issues).
